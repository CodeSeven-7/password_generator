Some things to consider about passwords:

    You likely have more passwords than you can possibly remember. You don't have to.
    Write your passwords down in a safe place. Use a password manager or an encrypted file. Set a strong master password that you can remember.
    The strong passwords we generate contains lower-case and upper-case letters, numbers, and symbols in a random arrangement.
